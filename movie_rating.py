#Create a dictionary named movie-ratings with at least five movies as keys and their ratings (out of 10) as values. 
#Ask the user for a movie title. Write a function named recommend_movie that takes the movie_rating dictionary 
#and the movie title as arguments. The function should check if the movie is in the dictionary and recommend 
#the movie if it has a rating of 8 or higher. Otherwise, suggest movie titles that have a rating of 8 or higher. 
#If the movie is not found in the dictionary, it should still recommend movies that are rated 8 or higher.
